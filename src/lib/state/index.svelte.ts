// App-level state for the unified-stream model.
//
// **Why this module exists.** Per-agent state outlives any particular UI
// component: subscriptions persist for the lifetime of the app session,
// regardless of which agent the user is "looking at" (per AGENTS.md: no
// singleton "active" or "focused" agent). The state therefore lives one
// layer above any component, in this module.
//
// **Lifetime contract** (per system-design §3):
// - Subscriptions register at agent creation/load time (`registerAgent`).
// - They are NEVER torn down. `set_active_project` is display-only and
//   does not unregister listeners (background events for other projects
//   continue flowing into state).
// - On app close: process exit; no explicit cleanup needed.
//
// **Per-agent isolation.** Each event arrives on `agent:<agent_id>`. The
// listener registered for that channel is the only one that sees those
// events; routing is by channel, not by any in-payload `agent_id`
// matching. This makes cross-agent contamination structurally impossible
// (a regression would require the wrong channel name).
//
// **Wall-clock boundary.** This module is the **only place** that mints
// receive-time timestamps for tool events. The pure reducers
// (`transcriptReducer` / `runtimeReducer`) accept a `receivedAt` parameter;
// this module computes `new Date().toISOString()` once per event at the
// listener boundary and threads it through. Tests can drive the reducers
// with fixed timestamps for deterministic assertions.
//
// **UI integration**: App.svelte calls `registerAgent` at project-open
// time and on dynamic agent add. Sidebar / UnifiedTranscript / ComposeBar
// components read `transcripts` / `runtimes` directly. ComposeBar
// drives `dispatchUserTurn` + Tauri `send_message` + `failSendStart` on
// IPC error.
