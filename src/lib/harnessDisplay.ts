/// Display-only lookup tables for harness rendering. Separate from
/// `harnessAvailability.ts` (which is probe-state copy and gate predicates)
/// because the concerns are distinct: this module answers "what does the
/// label / badge for harness X look like?" — pure presentation, no probe
/// state. The split keeps a future change to one (e.g., adding an icon to
/// every label) from forcing test updates in the other.
///
/// **No `default` arm.** Each map is typed `Record<HarnessKind, string>`,
/// which makes exhaustiveness compile-time enforced. A future harness
/// landing without a frontend update fails type-check at the map literal,
/// not at runtime with a gray "?". Mirrors the `#[non_exhaustive]`
/// discipline on the Rust side: adding a variant forces a deliberate
/// downstream update rather than silently degrading.
